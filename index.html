			<h3>About Me</h3>

			<p>Welcome! I am an undergraduate student currently pursuing a B.A. in Journalism with concentrations in Reporting and Strategic Communication at the UW-Madison School of Journalism & Mass Communication. I am working to obtain certificates in Business and Digital Studies, as well.</p>

			<p>Recent works can be found in publications such as the <a href="https://nypost.com/author/jessica-sonkin/">New York Post</a>, including <a href="https://pagesix.com/author/jessica-sonkin/">Page Six</a>, and the <a href="https://www.dailycardinal.com/staff/jessica-sonkin">Daily Cardinal</a> across digital and print platforms. Reporting experience includes metro, crime, political and legal coverage. As news manager, staff writer and former campus news editor at the Daily Cardinal, I assist with the coordination of campus, college, city, state and associate news coverage. Additional experiences in communication include public relations, promotion and entertainment marketing.</p>

			<p>To date, my greatest possession in life is a regular byline — a chance to be the eyes, ears and hopefully clear and unfiltered voice of many communities. I strive to communicate in an unbiased and approachable manner, dissecting both micro- and macro-level stories in an effort to find and chronicle humanity in the face of adversity.</p>
